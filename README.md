## Deere Project 4 - FRONTEND
## Overview
Project 4 is a fullstack aplication consiting of a Express/Node.js Backend (BE) and a React-App Frontend (FE)
This README.md is for the FRONTEND portion.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## App Description:
App is Flashcard 2.0 which is built off of Project 1 Flashcard 1.0.  Version 1.0 was only a frontend app.  V2.0 adds a backend to store flashcard decks, permanently keep user/student scores and progress, etc.

So what is "Flashcard x.0"?  It is intended as an educational game/tool that can be played by even very young children.  V1.0 used keyboard only to 'play' the deck.  This avoided difficulties that young users may have with controlling a mouse.  V2.0 adds the backend allowing decks to be added.  

What is future for Flashcard?  Version 3.0 will include V1.0 game play refactored from basic JS to JavaScript React.  Additionally, V3.0 will have ability for a non-IT parent/home-educator to load up a custom deck to BE.  Finally, V3.0 will need to have authentication added for user/player privacy, etc.

## Note: INITIAL_PLANNING.md is in BACKEND repo and contains initial planning file that was approved for entire project and covers initial planning for both FE & BE.
